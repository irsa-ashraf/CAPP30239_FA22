# Bar Chart Exercise
For this week's assignment I created a bar chart that shows the number of library visits during Januray 2022 for libraries in different zipcodes of Chicago.



# Final Project

Source: Yelp and US Census Data 

Links:

Description of data:

I extracted data from Yelp using their API on businesses called 'restaurants' in New York City. 
The data on median household income is census data downlaoded from the official census data site.

Why you are interested in this topic:

I have alwasy been fascinated by the diversity in New York and love discovering new restuarants all over the city. So I wanted to see (through a visual) what areas specifically have certain cuisines and if the median income of an area influences the price of food.  

Identify if source is primary or secondary: 
Primary
