I am a second year Masters in Computational Analysis and Public Policy (MSCAPP) student at the University of Chicago. I am originally from Karachi, Pakistan and I earned my B.A. in Economics and Global Studies from UCLA. My interests are in data science and technology policy and I'm excited about learning new data visualization techniques that will allow me to communicate with a broader audience.
